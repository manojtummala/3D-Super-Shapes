# 3D-Super-Shapes

3D Super shapes are the shapes are that which are kind of extensions of sphere and ecclipse using [**"Super Formula"**](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/supershape/).

The general formula for the supershape is given below:

Where r and phi are polar coordinates (radius,angle). n1, n2, n3, and m are real numbers. a and b are real numbers excluding zero.
